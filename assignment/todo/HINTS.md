### Structure

#### 1. Home Page

* This is the structure of your home page and what widgets your required to implement.
you'll need to add a `FloatingActionButton` to the scaffold and in the on pressed you will navigate to `TaskPage` and capture the returned result from it.
* after storing the result update your UI.
* Check for the status change in the `CheckBox` widget and update your state accordingly.
